<p>The working directory is /home</p>
<p>I got the output because the function of the command cd is to change directory. Since I am already in the directory of /home, there is nothing changed although there is no argument.</p>
<p>It is not an error because there is no error message and the output shows that the command of cd functions rightly.</p>

# cd directory

<p>The working directory is /home</p>
<p>I got the output which is changing the directory to /home/lecture1 because the function of the command cd is change directory, and the argument as directory shows the targeting directory. </p>
<p>It is not an error because it successfully change the working directory.</p>

# cd file

<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got the output saying that the file HelloJava is not a directory.</p>
