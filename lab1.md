# cd no arguments
![Image](cd_no_argument.png)

<p>The working directory is /home</p>
<p>I got the output because the function of the command cd is to change directory. Since I am already in the directory of /home, there is nothing changed although there is no argument.</p>
<p>It is not an error because there is no error message and the output shows that the command of cd functions rightly.</p>

# cd directory
![Image](cd_directory.png)

<p>The working directory is /home</p>
<p>I got the output which is changing the directory to /home/lecture1 because the function of the command cd is change directory, and the argument as directory shows the targeting directory. </p>
<p>It is not an error because it successfully change the working directory.</p>

# cd file
![Image](cd_file.png)

<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got the output saying that the file HelloJava is not a directory.</p>
<p>It is an error because the command cd cannot used on a file, but only a directory.</p>

# ls no argument
![Image](ls_no_argument.png)

<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got a list of files and directory that is under the working directory, which is lecture1.</p>
<p>It is not an error because the command ls is used for getting a list of the directory. Since there is no argument, ls provides the list of file under current working directory.</p>

# ls directory
![Image](ls_directory.png)

<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got a list of files that is under the directory of my command, which is messages/.</p>
<p>It is not an error because the command run successfully, showing the list of files under the directory that I type for command.</p>

# ls file
![Image](ls_file.png)

<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got the name of the file that is on the command line.</p>
<p>It is not an error in my opinion, but I think it is not a good use of the command. Since there is no error messages and it runs properly, however, it does not provide me useful outputs, but only the name of the file.</p>

# cat no argument
![Image](cat_no_argument.png)

<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got nothing but all blank. I cannot enter any other commands as well.</p>
<p>This is an error because the terminal stucks after I run the command without an argument. There is no output and the terminal runs forever with the blank. </p>

# cat directory
![Image](cat_directory.png)
<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got a line said that my input directory is a directory.</p>
<p>It is not an error because it can runs well, however, it is not a good use too, since the command line does not provide useful information.</p>

# cat file
![Image](cat_file.png)
<p>The working directory is /home/lecture1</p>
<p>I got the exact context of the file that I command.</p>
<p>It is not an error since the command cat's purpose is to show the lines of the target file. And this line of command and output works properly.</p>
