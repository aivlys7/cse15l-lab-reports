<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got the output od backing to the `/home` directory because the function of the command cd is to change directory. When there is no argument, the default action of the command is to go back to the `/home` directory.</p>
<p>It is not an error because there is no error message and the output shows that the command of cd functions rightly.</p>

`cd` **directory**

<p>The working directory is `/home`</p>
<p>I got the output which is changing the directory to `/home/lecture1` because the function of the command cd is change directory, and the argument as directory shows the targeting directory. </p>
<p>It is not an error because it successfully change the working directory.</p>

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got the output saying that the file `HelloJava` is not a directory.</p>
<p>It is an error because the command cd cannot used on a file, but only a directory.</p>

`ls` **no argument**

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got a list of files and directory that is under the working directory, which is `/lecture1`.</p>
<p>It is not an error because the command ls is used for getting a list of the directory. Since there is no argument, ls provides the list of file under current working directory.</p>

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got a list of files that is under the directory of my command, which is `/messages`.</p>

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got the name of the file that is on the command line.</p>
<p>It is not an error in my opinion, but I think it is not a good use of the command. Since there is no error messages and it runs properly, however, it does not provide me useful outputs, but only the name of the file.</p>

`cat` **no argument**

![Image](cat_no_argument_update.png)

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got nothing but all blank. When I type something to the blank and press enter, the terminal will simply repeat the line that I typed. Aany other commands are not function well as well.</p>
<p>This is an error because the terminal stucks after I run the command without an argument. There is no output and the terminal runs forever with the blank. And I have to use `ctrl C` to force quit the error blank.</p>

`cat` **directory**

![Image](cat_directory.png)

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got a line said that my input directory is a directory.</p>
<p>It is an error because it shows that the command cat cannot be used toward a directory, since the command line does not work its function.</p>

`cat` **file**

![Image](cat_file.png)

<p>The working directory is `/home/lecture1`</p>
<p>I got the exact context of the file that I command.</p>
<p>It is not an error since the command cat's purpose is to show the lines of the target file. And this line of command and output works properly.</p>
